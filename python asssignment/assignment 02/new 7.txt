
ASSIGNMENT 02

1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ans: 
true,false
 
a=true
type(a)
--> class bool

x=5
y=4
print(bool(x==y))
--> false

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
and, or , not

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ans: A       B            A and B     A or B  notA
   True     True           True       True    False
   False    True           False      True    True
   True     False          False      True   
   False    False          false      Flase
   
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) : False
not (5 > 4) : False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) : True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  : False 
(True and True) and (True == False) : False 
(not False) or (not True) : True 

5. What are the six comparison operators?
ans: Greater than
Less than
Equal to
Not equal to
Greater than or equal to
Less than or equal to


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
ans: The assignment operator is used to assign the values to the variable.
The equality operator is used to compare the values of both the variables and the result is true or false

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0

###### block 01

if spam == 10:
	print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
	print('bacon')
else:
	print('ham')
### blocks 02

print('spam')

### blocks 03
	
print('spam')
 
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = 1
if spam == 1:
	print("Hello")

elif spam ==2:
	print("Howdy")
	
else:
	print("Greetings !")
	

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
ans: ctrl+c 

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
ans: Break:A break statement in Python alters the flow of a loop by terminating it once a specified condition is met.
Continue: The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ans: range(10) : 
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 total 10 element staring from 0 but here starting point is not defined so python takes 0 bydefault.
range(0,10): 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 total 10 element staring from 0 but here starting point is defined so python takes 0 bydefault.
range(0,1,10): 0,2,4,6,8 total 5 element from 0 to 10 gaving step 1


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range (10):
    print(i)
	
i=0
while i<10:	
	print(i)
	i+=1
	
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
ans:
import spam
or
from spam import bacon

model = spam.bacon()
