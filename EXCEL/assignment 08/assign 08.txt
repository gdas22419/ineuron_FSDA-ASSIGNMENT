-----------------------********************************--------------------------------
1. What does the dollar($) sign do?
ans : Dollar sign indicates ansolute refrence , When a formula contains an absolute reference,
 no matter which cell the formula occupies the cell reference does not change: if you copy or 
 move the formula, it refers to the same cell as it did in its original location.
 
2. How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed)?
ans : Click the formula box (shown below) or highlight the formula and press the F4 key 
to switch between an absolute and relative cell reference.

3. Explain the order of operations in excel?
ans: Formulas calculate values in a specific order. A formula in Excel always begins with an 
 equal sign (=). Excel interprets the characters that follow the equal sign as a formula.
 Following the equal sign are the elements to be calculated (the operands), such as constants or 
 cell references. These are separated by calculation operators. Excel calculates the formula from left to right,
 according to a specific order for each operator in the formula.
 
 4. What, according to you, are the top 5 functions in excel and write a basic syntax for any of two?
 
 ans : 
 1. IF function :
	Syntax: =IF(A1>B2; “TRUE”; “FALSE”)
	
2. vlookup function :
	syntax : = VLOOKUP([value], [range], [column number], [false or true])
	* The value you want to look up;
	* The range in which you want to find the value and the return value;
	* The number of the column within your defined range, that contains the return value;
	* 0 or FALSE for an exact match with the value your are looking for; 1 or TRUE for an approximate match.
	
3. Hlookup function:
	Syntax: HLOOKUP([value], [range], [row number], [false or true])
	* The value you want to look up;
	* The range in which you want to find the value and the return value;
	* The number of the row within your defined range, that contains the return value;
	* 0 or FALSE for an exact match with the value your are looking for; 1 or TRUE for an approximate match.
	
4. AVERAGE function :
	syntax : “=AVERAGE(C2, C3, C4)” 
	It automatically calculates the average, and you can store the result in your desired location.
	
5. CONCATENATE function :
	syntax : "=CONCATENATE(A25, " ", B25)" 
	
5. 5. When would you use the subtotal function?

ans: subtotal calculation on cells ranging from A2 to A4
	syntax : “=SUBTOTAL(1, A2: A4)"
	
6. What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?
ans:	syntax : = VLOOKUP([value], [range], [column number], [false or true])
	* The value you want to look up;
	* The range in which you want to find the value and the return value;
	* The number of the column within your defined range, that contains the return value;
	* 0 or FALSE for an exact match with the value your are looking for; 1 or TRUE for an approximate match.
