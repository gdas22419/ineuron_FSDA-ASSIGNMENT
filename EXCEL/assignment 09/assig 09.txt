1. What are the different margins options and do we adjust the margins of
the excel worksheet?
ans:
There are four margins you can specify: top, bottom, left, and right. Each margin refers to the 
distance from the edge of the paper to where the information in your worksheet can be printed.

2. Set a background for your table created.
ans:
The background color of the table is given by the bgcolor="color" attribute.
 When applied to the <table> tag, the color fills the background. Cell background colors 
 are set by applying the bgcolor attribute to a <tr> tag (to color the row) or to a <td> tag (to color the cell).

some quick sheet options are also present on the Excel ribbon and can be accessed by going to 
Page Layout > Sheet Options. It mainly has four toggle options: two for Gridlines and two for Headings,
 and they can be turned on and off by selecting and deselecting the checkboxes.
 
 The right-click with mouse button usually displays the context menu for the selected element.
When we press the right-click on any Sheet tabs, Excel displays a list of options relevant to Excel sheets. 
The list includes various sheet options. However, this list is usually called the 'worksheet menu'.
