1. Explain the advantages of Natural Queries in PowerBi with an example

date function  : date.IsInNextDay


2. Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?

Clients and the back end are connected by the front end, commonly known as the 
web front-end cluster. The front-end services handle the initial connection and]
 Azure Active Directory client authentication. User IDs are kept in the Azure Active Directory.
 After authentication, user requests are routed through Azure Traffic Manager to the closest data center.
 The Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) makes static Power BI content and files available
 to users when a client or user has been authorized. 
 
 3. Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?
 
 Visualizations, datasets, storage, reports, data connections, data updating, and other
 Power BI interactions are handled by the Power BI services on the back end. A web client
 can only directly interface with Azure API Management and Gateway Role on the backend.
 These two parts are in charge of routing, load balancing, authentication, and authorization. 
 
4. What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?

By using ASP.NET component  WFE cluster can be create

 Microsoft Excel:
 
  data import :
  We can import data by using get data_tab but data sources are min like(csv,text,XML,JSOn)

  Data transformation:
  we have multiple op[tions for data transformation by usning quarry as well as by using diifent tab in excel
  alsmost same in power bi.
 data modeling:
 It allows integrating data from multiple tables by creating relationships based on a common column.
 It is saved in memory, where we cannot directly see it.
 commands:
 data_tab>connections 
 data_tab> relationships
 
 Reporting:
 we can create report by using pivot table slicer, and many visualizations options 
 power bI
 Server Deployment:
 
   data import :
   
  we can import data by get data_tab here we have multiple options 
  
  Data transformation:
  we have multiple op[tions for data transformation by using power quarry
we have more than 900 m function also for data transformation.

 Reporting:
 we can create report by usning differnt charts cards and slicer and many more 
 
 data modeling:
  data modeling:
  A relationship defines how data sources are connected with each other and you can create interesting 
  data visualizations on multiple data sources.
  
  directly through modeling_tab
